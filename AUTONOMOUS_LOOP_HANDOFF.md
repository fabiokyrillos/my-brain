# Autonomous loop handoff

Append-only. Newest section last. Each section records what a loop actually
left behind — not what it intended — so the next one can start from repository
truth instead of from a summary.

## §33 — SH.6 closed: deployed, accepted, and deliberately not purging (2026-08-05)

### Where things stand

- **`main` = the SH.6 close.** PR #93 merged at `cf540c7`, PR #94 at `6228a88`,
  both with exact merge-SHA CI green on all three jobs. Branches
  `codex/sh-slice-6-quotas` and `codex/sh-slice-6-retention` are preserved.
- **Hosted migration parity: `202608050077`.** Both SH.6 migrations are applied
  to `ulvwzqlpsjyrnqzfxmck`. **The eight-migration Signup Hardening budget is
  fully spent and was not exceeded.** Any further SH work needing DDL is an
  owner budget amendment.
- **Public signup is disabled** at both layers and never moved during this loop.
- **SMTP is still unconfigured** (`smtp_host = null`, read back). No readiness is
  claimed; the SMTP-blocked SH.5 residuals stay open.
- **SH.7 has not started.**

### What is proven, and where the evidence is

`docs/reports/SIGNUP_HARDENING_SH6_DEPLOYMENT.md` holds every readback. The
headline results:

- Quota ceilings hold under **genuine concurrency** on the deployed database:
  60 simultaneous inserts, ceiling 50, exactly 50 admitted and 50 *stored*.
- The rest of the deployed quota lane: **11/11**, residual rows **0**.
- Retention dry-run: **0 eligible rows in all seven classes**, boundary evidence
  recorded, no sweep executed.
- **T-26 closed on the table**: `service_role` is refused (403) on
  `user_ai_credentials` and `credential_validation_attempts`, with master-key
  rotation proven still working through `admin_list_credential_envelopes`.
- The `heartbeat` Edge Function is **undeployed** and reads back 404; the next
  hourly in-database tick ran `completed` at `21:00:00Z`, so the disposition is
  observed and not merely argued.

### The one thing a successor must not misread

**Nothing schedules the retention sweeps, and that is deliberate.**

Migration `202608050077` ends with a `cron.schedule` block, so applying it
scheduled all seven destructive sweeps — five of which had never run against
production and none of which the owner had authorized. The first live purge
would have executed at 04:11 UTC the following morning, with the dry-run
transcript arriving afterwards to describe a deletion that had already happened.

Those five schedules, plus a duplicate of BYOK's own validation sweep, were
removed the same day. `sh-prune-auth-event-attempts` (SH.5) and
`byok-prune-validation-attempts` (BYOK) were left exactly as they were, because
they were authorized then and undoing them would be reversing someone else's
decision.

If a later loop finds the sweeps unscheduled: **that is the closed state, not an
incomplete deployment.** `scripts/sh6-retention-schedule.mjs --status` reads the
posture; `--enable` **is** the authorization of the first live purge. ADR-082
records the general rule — a migration may create a destructive mechanism and may
not schedule one.

**The first live production purge is NOT AUTHORIZED and NOT EXECUTED.**

### Why `sweepActive` is still false

`src/features/legal/retention.ts` keeps every window's `sweepActive: false`, so
the Privacy Policy still renders its honest-notice warning. Deployed is not
enforced: a window whose sweep is not scheduled is not being applied to anyone,
and a flag claiming otherwise would be T-31 in its purest form. The flags flip
when the schedule is enabled — in the same commit that deletes the
"at least one window is genuinely unenforced" test in `documents.test.ts`.

### Five defects this slice found, and what each teaches

Kept because the causes generalise:

1. **A `BEFORE ... FOR EACH ROW` trigger cannot see its own statement's earlier
   rows** (their `cmin` is the executing command). Any per-owner ceiling checked
   that way falls to a single array-bodied POST. Use statement triggers over
   transition tables, and compare `used > ceiling`.
2. **This schema has no `exhausted` job status.** A `failed` job with attempts
   spent lives forever, so counting it as "live" is a permanent lockout, not a
   ceiling.
3. **A PRD's claim that "nothing uses this grant" is a hypothesis.** Two real
   callers depended on the `service_role` grant SH-EXPOSURE-001 removes; they
   were narrowed rather than the closure being weakened.
4. **Deriving an expectation from the same source the code came from proves
   less than it looks like.** The grant census must read the catalog, not the
   migration chain — platform defaults grant privileges no migration mentions.
5. **A migration that schedules a destructive sweep has already authorized it.**
   See above; this is the one that would have caused real harm on a slightly
   older database.

### Owner actions outstanding

Exactly one belongs to SH.6, and it is optional:

- **Enable the retention schedule**, if and when the sweeps should start running:
  `npm run sh6:retention-dry-run` then
  `npm run sh6:retention-schedule -- --enable`. Enabling authorizes the first
  live purge; purged rows are unrecoverable.

Carried forward from earlier slices, unchanged and not SH.6's:

- Configure custom SMTP (Resend) — unblocks the SH.5 confirmation and
  delivered-link journeys and the final resend ceiling.
- SH-SIGNUP-011's timing residual has still not been measured.

### Next

SH.7 — rollout gates and convergence, **0 migrations**. It may build and run
every non-destructive gate. It must not open public signup, execute a purge,
claim SMTP readiness, or start Phase 2G/2H.

*(§33's "Next" is answered by §34 below.)*

---

## §34 — SH.7 closed: the initiative is complete and the gate says no (2026-08-05)

### Where things stand

- **Signup Hardening is COMPLETE, SH.0 through SH.7.** Zero migrations in SH.7;
  the chain head stays `202608050077` and hosted parity matches it.
- **Public signup is closed and this initiative did not open it.** SH-ROLLOUT-005
  is post-initiative and owner-only by design.

### The output

`npm run rollout:verify` — **25 pass · 3 fail · 2 owner-signature** against the
deployed project. A failed or unsigned gate is a closed door, and the script has
no path that reports otherwise.

The remaining distance, all honest:

| Gate | Why it is red |
| --- | --- |
| RG-QUO-3 | retention sweeps deliberately unscheduled (ADR-082) |
| RG-DEP-1 | production SMTP not configured |
| RG-DEP-3 | backup restore to a disposable project never performed (SH-GD.2) |
| RG-LEG-4 | professional legal review — owner signature |
| RG-DEP-4 | monitoring adequacy — owner signature |

Opening signup is one green run of that script, an owner flip of
`disable_signup`, then a second green run against the open state.

### What a successor should not redo

- **The gate's fail-closed direction is tested** — 30 cases, the decisive one
  being that no gate passes against an empty repository. Do not "simplify" a
  gate into a skip; that is the whole failure mode it was built against.
- **The traceability matrix is generated, not written.**
  `npm run docs:signup-hardening:traceability` fails rather than print an
  unresolved claim, so hand-editing the matrix produces a claim nothing checked.
- **The re-census delta is measured and bounded.** Hosted grants `anon` EXECUTE
  on eight pre-existing trigger functions CI does not show; all eight were
  probed and are unreachable through PostgREST (`404 PGRST202`, and `0A000` for
  the event-trigger one). A catalog difference, not a reachable one. Revoking
  them needs a migration nobody budgeted and would remove zero exposure.

### Owner actions outstanding

No repository work is waiting. What remains is owner judgment or configuration:

1. **Enable the retention schedule** if the sweeps should run:
   `npm run sh6:retention-dry-run` then
   `npm run sh6:retention-schedule -- --enable`. Enabling **is** the
   authorization of the first live purge; purged rows are unrecoverable.
2. **Configure custom SMTP** (Resend) — closes RG-DEP-1 and unblocks the three
   SMTP-deferred SH.5 requirements.
3. **Restore a backup to a disposable project** and record it — closes RG-DEP-3.
4. **Sign the two judgment gates**: professional legal review, and monitoring and
   incident-handling adequacy.

### Next

**Phase 2G — Conversational Creation** is the roadmap successor (ADR-073, plan
§8: Signup Hardening → 2G → 2H → open signup). It is **not authorised** by
anything written so far and needs an owner decision to begin.
